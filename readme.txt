WordPress integration for EnterMedia

== How to Use with EnterMedia ==

The Enhanced Media Library plugin provides many ways to categorize and deploy your media once it is already in WordPress, but what does the EnterMedia extension add?  Through the use of EnterMedia's publishing feature, assets from an EnterMedia DAM can be published directly to a WordPress site and some metadata (currently just libraries and keywords) can be sent along and automatically attached to the files as WordPress metadata.  This process can be completed as follows:

0. Before you can get started, ensure that your EnterMedia DAM is operational and that this plugin has been imported to WordPress.

1. To install the plugin, either unzip full contents to 'wp-content/plugins' or import the zip file using the WordPress UI. Once this is complete, navigate the the Plugins menu in WordPress and activate the EnterMedia MediaDB Enhanced Media Library plugin.

2. The first step is to go to the plugin directory and navigate to upload_util/upload.php. The first line of code in this file is a reference to the access key you should be using to ensure that foreign data is not accepted. Change the value of $entermediakey to anything you want.

3. In the EnterMedia Settings -> Data Manager, select publishdestination from the table drop down. Create a new publish destination and edit the fields such that its Path/URL is the path to the upload.php file included with this plugin (upload_util/upload.php) as it will be accessible in your WordPress site. This is most likely something like http://www.yourwpsiteroot.com/wp-content/plugins/entermediadb/upload_util/upload.php. Change the Access Key field to have the value you changed $entermediakey to. This will ensure that any POST data you send has the key that the plugin needs. When you are finished editing the publish destination, use the save button at the bottom to save the results in the table.

4. Now, publish assets through the UI or create an Export Order using the JSON API, and publish to your new destination. This will add the assets to WordPress Media Library, including library metadata as a custom taxonomy. WordPress does further conversions on your images, so send the original format for best results.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why my custom media taxonomy's page is 404? =

Try to just re-save permalinks settings. Go to Settings >> Permalinks and push "Save Changes" button.

= Why Media Popup of some themes/plugins does not show taxonomy filters? =

EML adds its filters to ANY media popup that already contains native WordPress filters. We chose NOT to force adding filters to ANY media popup because there are a lot of cases when filters are not acceptable and theme's/plugin's author did not add them intentionally.

If you believe that a third-party plugin shoud have filters in its Media Popup please contact its author with a request to add NATIVE WordPress filters ([example of the code](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-can-we-use-this-plugin-features-in-my-custom-plugin-media-uploader?replies=15#post-5753212) for theme's/plugin's authors).

= How to show images per media category on a webpage =

Right now it is possible via WP_Query ([example of the code](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-displaying-an-array-of-images-per-category-or-categories)). We are working on a gallery based on EML taxonomies.
